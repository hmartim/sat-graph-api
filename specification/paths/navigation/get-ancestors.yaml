  summary: "Retrieves the hierarchical ancestors of a single Item."
  operationId: "getAncestors"
  description: |
    Navigates the hierarchy upwards from a specific structural `Item` to its parent, grandparent, and so on, up to the root `Work`. This is crucial for retrieving the full contextual path ("breadcrumb") of any given provision.

    The returned list is **ordered** from the highest-level ancestor (e.g., a `Title`) down to the immediate parent of the input item. The root `Work` and the item itself are excluded from the list.

    ### Discussion
    This action is the fundamental tool for contextualization. After a search identifies a relevant item, an agent should use `getAncestors` to retrieve its structural path. This allows the generation of richer, context-aware responses, significantly improving the quality and explainability of the final answer.
