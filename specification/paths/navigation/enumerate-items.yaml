    summary: "Enumerates Items within a structural or thematic scope."
    operationId: "enumerateItems"
    description: |
      Enumerates and returns full `Item` objects based on a specified structural or thematic scope. At least one of `item_ids` or `theme_ids` must be provided.

      ### Scope Logic
      - If both `item_ids` and `theme_ids` are provided, the function returns the **union** of all items found in both scopes (without duplicates).
      - The `depth` parameter applies exclusively to scopes defined by `item_ids`.

      ### Discussion
      This action's purpose is **structural enumeration and navigation**, not search filtering. It is the correct tool for tasks like building a table of contents or programmatically exploring the members of a conceptual theme. For performing content-based searches within a scope, agents should pass the scope's ID directly to the search functions (`searchTextUnits`, `searchItems`), as this is significantly more performant.
