  summary: "Retrieves the hierarchy (all descendant IDs) for a Theme in the taxonomy."
  operationId: "getThemeHierarchy"
  description: |
    Returns a flat list of all descendant Theme IDs for a given Theme node in the
    poly-hierarchical taxonomy, including the requested Theme ID itself.

    ### Use Case: Hierarchical Thematic Filtering

    This endpoint is essential for search operations with theme-based filtering. When a user
    specifies a high-level Theme (e.g., "Public Law"), the agent needs to include all
    sub-themes (Social Security, Tax Law, Administrative Law, etc.) in the search filter.

    **Example Workflow:**
    ```
    User: "Find all items about Public Law"

    Agent:
    1. Resolve "Public Law" → theme_id: "theme:public-law"
    2. Call getThemeHierarchy("theme:public-law")
       → ["theme:public-law", "theme:social-security", "theme:tax-law", ...]
    3. Call searchItems(theme_ids=[...all descendants...])
    ```

    ### Discussion

    Without this endpoint, agents would need to recursively traverse the thematic taxonomy
    with multiple `getTheme` calls, creating inefficiency and complexity. This single
    endpoint provides the complete descendant set in one request.

    The returned list is unordered and includes the root Theme ID itself, making it
    ready to use directly in filter parameters.

    **Note on Poly-Hierarchy:** Since Themes can have multiple parents, the descendant
    set includes all nodes reachable by following any path downward from the root Theme.
    This may result in larger sets than expected if the taxonomy has significant overlap.
