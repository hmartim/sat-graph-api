  description: |
    An aggregate analysis action that provides a high-level summary of changes that occurred within a specific scope during a defined time period.

    ### Discussion
    This powerful action enables macro-level analysis by offloading complex processing to the server. It is the primary primitive for answering broad questions about evolution. The `ImpactReport` intentionally contains lightweight identifiers, allowing an agent to selectively hydrate full details using batch operations as needed.
