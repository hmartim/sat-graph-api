  operationId: "getItemChildren"
  description: |
    Given an Item ID, this action returns the list of its immediate structural children.

    This is a **deterministic action**: Given the same `itemId`, it will always return
    the same set of children (the structural hierarchy of Items is stable and timeless).

    This endpoint is designed for efficient structural navigation without loading
    potentially large child arrays into every Item response. It is particularly useful
    for items with many children (e.g., articles with numerous paragraphs or incisos).
