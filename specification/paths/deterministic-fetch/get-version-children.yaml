  summary: "Returns the immediate structural children of a specific Version."
  operationId: "getVersionChildren"
  description: |
    Given a Version ID, this action returns the list of its immediate structural children
    (component Versions that comprise this Version).

    This is a **deterministic action**: Given the same `versionId`, it will always return
    the same set of children Versions.

    **Temporal Aggregation:** Under the SAT-Graph's aggregation model, a Version is composed
    by aggregating the most recent valid versions of all its child components at the time
    of its creation. Some children may be newly created while others are reused from previous
    states (unchanged components).

    This endpoint is designed for efficient structural navigation without loading potentially
    large child arrays into every Version response.
