  description: |
    Fetches the full `ItemType` object given its unique identifier.

    ### Discussion
    This is a deterministic fetch operation that returns complete ItemType data,
    including its position in the taxonomy (parents and children), metadata, and
    the canonical URI/URN if available.

    This endpoint is essential for:
    - Validating item hierarchies (checking if a type can contain another)
    - Displaying type information in UIs
    - Building type-aware editors and forms
    - Understanding the type system structure
