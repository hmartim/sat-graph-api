  summary: "Gets a batch of Action objects by their unique IDs."
  operationId: "getBatchActions"
  description: |
    A batch-optimized version of `getAction`. Given a list of action identifiers, it efficiently retrieves the full data object for each corresponding `Action` in a single request.

    ### Discussion
    This action is essential for the "hydration" step of analytical queries. After an agent discovers a set of relevant `Action` IDs via a function like `summarizeImpact`, this batch operation allows it to retrieve the full details of each action to build a complete and auditable report without the high performance cost of N+1 individual requests.
