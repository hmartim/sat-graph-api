    ### Discussion
    While the primary method for discovering `TextUnit`s is through the `searchTextUnits` function, this deterministic endpoint provides direct, primary-key-based access. It ensures API completeness, allowing a client to retrieve a specific text snippet if it only has its ID, which might occur in advanced logging or auditing workflows.
