  summary: "Performs a hybrid search for Themes based on their descriptions."
  operationId: "searchThemes"
  description: |
    Performs a hybrid search to discover `Theme` nodes based on a descriptive query, combining semantic and lexical search capabilities with advanced filtering.

    This action **searches exclusively on the textual descriptions associated with the themes themselves**, mapping a user's description to the most appropriate formal concept in the knowledge graph.

    ### Search Strategy
    The unified `content_query` parameter leverages Oracle 23ai's native hybrid search with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF), allowing for:
    - Broad conceptual matching via semantic search
    - High-precision keyword filtering via lexical search
    - Advanced clauses for mandatory terms, boosting, and exclusions
