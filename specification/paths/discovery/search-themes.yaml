  summary: "Performs a hybrid search for Themes based on their descriptions."
  operationId: "searchThemes"
  description: |
    Performs a hybrid (semantic and/or lexical) search to discover `Theme` nodes based on a descriptive query. 
    This action **searches exclusively on the textual descriptions associated with the themes themselves**.
    
    At least one of `semantic_query` or `lexical_query` must be provided.
    
    ### Discussion
    This action's purpose is to map a user's description of a topic to the most appropriate formal concept in the graph. 
    The design allows for both broad conceptual matching (via `semantic_query`) and high-precision keyword filtering (via `lexical_query`).
