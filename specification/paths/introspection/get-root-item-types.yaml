  summary: "Gets the root nodes of the ItemType taxonomy."
  operationId: "getRootItemTypes"
  description: |
    Retrieves a list of all `ItemType` objects that are at the root of the type taxonomy
    (i.e., types that have no parents within their category).

    ### Discussion
    This is the primary action for exploring the ItemType taxonomy. It provides an efficient
    entry point to the type system, allowing clients to render the top-level types and then
    "lazy-load" sub-trees by fetching children as needed.

    **Use Cases:**
    - Build cascading type selectors in UIs (select category → show root types → expand children)
    - Understand the top-level structure of the type system
    - Initialize type navigation interfaces
    - Generate documentation of the type hierarchy

    The optional `category` parameter allows filtering to only root types within a specific
    architectural category (e.g., only root types for "Work" or "Work Component").

        Optional. Filter root types to only those in a specific category.

        Valid values: `Work`, `Work Component`, `Term`, `Concept`, `Named Entity`.

        When omitted, returns root types across all categories.
      schema:
        type: string
        enum:
          - "Work"
          - "Work Component"
          - "Term"
          - "Concept"
          - "Named Entity"
      example: "Work Component"
