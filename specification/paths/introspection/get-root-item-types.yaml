  summary: "Gets the root nodes of the ItemType taxonomy."
  operationId: "getRootItemTypes"
  description: |
    Retrieves a list of all `ItemType` objects that are at the root of the type taxonomy
    (i.e., types that have no parents).

    ### Discussion
    This is the primary action for exploring the ItemType taxonomy. It provides an efficient
    entry point to the type system, allowing clients to render the top-level types and then
    "lazy-load" sub-trees by fetching children as needed.

    **Use Cases:**
    - Build type selectors in UIs and expand children as needed
    - Understand the top-level structure of the type system
    - Initialize type navigation interfaces
    - Generate documentation of the type hierarchy

    ### Datasource Filtering
    Different datasources may maintain their own ItemType taxonomies tailored to their specific
    document types and organizational structures. The optional `datasources` parameter allows
    clients to scope the results to specific datasources, which is particularly useful in
    federated or multi-tenant scenarios where each institution maintains its own type system.
