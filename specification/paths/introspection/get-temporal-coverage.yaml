  operationId: "getTemporalCoverage"
  description: |
    Returns the start and end dates of the known version history for a specific `Item`.

    ### Discussion
    This action enables an agent to be aware of its own knowledge boundaries. It should be used to proactively validate a user's temporal query before attempting retrieval, allowing for graceful handling of requests for dates outside the known history and improving the overall user experience.
