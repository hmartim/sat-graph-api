  summary: "Gets the root nodes of the thematic taxonomy."
  operationId: "getRootThemes"
  description: |
    Retrieves a list of all `Theme` objects that are at the root of the thematic taxonomy (i.e., themes that have no parents).

    ### Discussion
    This is the primary action for an agent or user interface to begin exploring the thematic ontology. It provides an efficient entry point to the taxonomy, allowing a client to render the top-level themes and then "lazy-load" sub-trees by fetching the children of each theme as needed. This approach is highly performant and scalable, avoiding the "N+1 query problem" that would arise from fetching a flat list of all themes.

    ### Datasource Filtering
    Different datasources may maintain their own thematic taxonomies. The optional `datasources` parameter allows clients to scope the results to specific datasources, which is particularly useful in federated or multi-tenant scenarios.
