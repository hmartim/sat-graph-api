  summary: "Gets the specific TextUnit for a Version in a given language."
  operationId: "getTextForVersion"
  description: |
    Deterministically retrieves a specific textual representation (a `TextUnit`) for a single, known `Version` in a given language. This is a direct-access, primary-key-based lookup, not a search operation.

    ### Discussion
    This action is fundamentally different from `searchTextUnits`. While the latter is a probabilistic discovery tool, `getTextForVersion` is a deterministic fetch. It serves the critical use case where an agent has already identified a specific `Version` (e.g., via `getValidVersion`) and requires its exact textual content.
