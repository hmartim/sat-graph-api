type: string
description: |
  Specifies the temporal resolution logic for finding a valid version.
  This is essential for guaranteeing determinism when multiple events occur on the same day.

  - `PointInTime`: (Strict) Finds the version whose validity interval strictly contains the exact timestamp.
  - `SnapshotLast`: (Common) Finds the last version that was valid at any point during the day of the given timestamp. Treats the query as "what was the state of the law at the end of this day?".
enum:
  - "PointInTime"
  - "SnapshotLast"
default: "SnapshotLast"
