# OpenAPI 3.x Schema for the 'TimeInterval' Data Model
#
# This schema defines a generic time interval using a start time and an
# optional end time. It supports full date-time precision.

type: array
description: >
  Represents a time interval defined by a start date-time and an optional end date-time.
  All values must conform to the RFC 3339 'date-time' format (e.g., 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ').

  **To represent a whole day, use the beginning of that day in UTC.** For example,
  the date '1988-10-05' should be represented as '1988-10-05T00:00:00Z'.

examples:
  closedInterval:
    summary: A closed interval with a start and end time
    description: Used for a version that has been superseded by another.
    value: ["1988-10-05T00:00:00Z", "2000-02-13T23:59:59Z"]
  openEndedInterval:
    summary: An open-ended interval for a current version
    description: >-
      The end time is explicitly null, indicating the version is still legally
      valid. This is the recommended representation for open intervals.
    value: ["2000-02-14T00:00:00Z", null]
