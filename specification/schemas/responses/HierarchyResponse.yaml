type: object
required:
  - root_id
  - descendant_ids
properties:
  root_id:
    $ref: '../core/ID.yaml'
    description: >-
      The ID of the root entity (ItemType or Theme) for which hierarchy was requested.
  descendant_ids:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: '../core/ID.yaml'
    description: >-
      A flat list of all descendant IDs in the hierarchy, including the root_id itself.
      This list includes all direct children, grandchildren, and deeper descendants.

      The order is not guaranteed to follow any specific traversal pattern (depth-first or breadth-first).
      Clients should treat this as an unordered set of IDs.

      **Use Case:** This list is designed to be passed directly to filter parameters in search
      or retrieval operations (e.g., `searchItems(item_type_ids=[...])` or `searchItems(theme_ids=[...])`).
    example:
      - "item-type:normative-component"
      - "item-type:article"
      - "item-type:paragraph"
      - "item-type:clause"
      - "item-type:item"
      - "item-type:subitem"
description: >-
  Response containing a flat list of all descendant IDs for a given hierarchy node (ItemType or Theme).
  Used for hierarchical filtering in search operations.
